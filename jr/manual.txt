I. Introduction
Limelight is a PNM image viewing and editing program, designed specifically for
computer vision research, typically involving repeated calling of a given function
on a given image, with changing parameters.  It is our goal for this program to 
create an interactive, efficient environment in which CV programs can be tested
and utilized.  Limelight allows users to attach their own functions to the program,
such that they then be easily run from within the Graphical User Interface.

Please not that this program is NOT suitable for simple image viewing.

This is currently a beta version, so we would be very appreciative of feedback from
users.  Please email vegan@cs.uchicago.edu and smitht@cs.uchicago.edu with detailed
information of any errors that may occur.


II. Installation
To install and run Limelight Jr., your computer must have current libraries for
OpenGL, GLUT, and PLIB.  OpenGL and GLUT can be obtained at GIVE ADDRESS, and
PLIB can be obtained at http://plib.sourceforge.net.  The Makefile provided
must be edited to point to the correct locations for PLIB and GLUT libraries.  Also,
below lines that say "for mac" lines should be commented out (with "#") if on a linux
machine, or uncommented for a mac, and the same for lines that read "for linux."

Once these libraries are installed, simply type "make," and the executable
"limelight" will be created.


III. Basic user interface
Limelight Jr. is called at the command line by the following syntax:
>limelight configfile [imagefile]
It is strongly recommended that the configuration file and image file both
be specified in terms of absolute paths.

If an imagefile is given, it will be automatically opened, otherwise Jr. will
open and wait for the user to open an image.

There are three windows to the program - the main window, the original image
window, and the output image window.

The main window has standard navigation functions for opening images, saving (output)
images, and a help menu.  Additionally, it has a function input box.  If the function
currently displayed in the pulldown menu is not correct, pull down the menu and select
the correct function, then hit "change."  If the function you want is not displayed,
check your configfile (described below) - it's syntax is not correct.

Based on your configfile, boxes for parameters will appear.  When parameters are
entered and the "run" button hit, the function will run and the output image
window will be changed to contain the results of this function.

Within both image windows, a user can accomplish a zoom (up to 10x) by holding
down the shift key, clicking the left mouse button, and dragging up to zoom in and
down to zoom out.  Once zoomed in, a user can pan around the body of the entire image by
left clicking and dragging in the desired direction.

Hotkeys:
Alt+Q = Quit program
Alt+O = Open
Alt+S = Save output image
Alt+W = Close image


IV. Configfile (.lime file)
The configfile holds data on what functions you might call.  This file must be created
by the user in a text editor (such as Emacs), and must end in ".lime".  The syntax is 
somewhat complex, but a sample file, "funct.lime," has been included - we suggest that you
copy the syntax from that.  A detailed description is also given in funct.lime
